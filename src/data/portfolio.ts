    bio: `Hi, I'm Ethan Qiu ‚Äî a software engineer with a strong interest in AI.

Right now, I'm working at General Dynamics Mission Systems - Canada and contributing to UTMIST (University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team), where I get to build cool things and learn alongside some amazing people. I'm also actively developing two personal projects: *Bounce Back*, a mental health app powered by AI, and *Road to 1 Million*, a goal-tracking app designed to turn ambition into progress.

What I love most about software is its power ‚Äî the way a few lines of code can shape ideas, tools, and entire experiences. I'm always looking to turn real-world problems into clean, scalable solutions.

Outside the terminal, I play badminton, compete in debate, and explore ideas that connect tech with people.

Always building. Always curious.`
